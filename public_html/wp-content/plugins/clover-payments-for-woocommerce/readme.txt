The Clover Payments plugin enables merchants that use WooCommerce to process online card payments using Clover.

== Description ==

The WordPress plugin from Clover allows a merchant using a WordPress based app like WooCommerce
to securely collect card information from buyers and process the payment using their Clover merchant account.

The payment extension uses iframes to collect card information. Card details are the tokenized by directly
communicating with a Clover’s servers. The payment is processed using this token and the card details are never saved on WordPress or the merchant’s servers. Therefore, this plug-in does not contribute to the PCI scope of a merchant’s eCommerce site. 

The plug-in is free for merchants to use and transactions processed using this plugin will be charged under the merchant’s Clover account.
